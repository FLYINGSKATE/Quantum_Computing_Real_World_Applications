However, the core functionality requires specifying the unit. Since hardcoding 'Angstrom' as a string worked in a previous attempt for the `PySCFDriver`, I will revert to that approach and remove the problematic `UnitsType` import line completely. This allows me to focus on the remaining steps of the molecular simulation, which are setting up and running the VQE algorithm and interpreting the results.\n",

        "The traceback indicates an ImportError within `qiskit-nature`, specifically trying to import `BaseEstimator` from `qiskit.primitives`. This suggests an incompatibility between the installed versions of `qiskit-nature` and `qiskit`. Based on the Qiskit 1.0 changes, `BaseEstimator` and `BaseSampler` were indeed removed from `qiskit.primitives`. The VQE class within `qiskit-nature` needs to be updated to use the new primitive interface. Since fixing this within the `qiskit-nature` library code is not feasible in this environment, the best approach is to try using a slightly older version of `qiskit-nature` that is compatible with the installed `qiskit` (2.1.2). Based on Qiskit documentation and release notes, `qiskit-nature==0.6.2` might be compatible with Qiskit versions around 0.4x/1.x. Let's try installing that specific version.\n",

        "The traceback indicates another `ImportError`, this time within `qiskit-terra` itself, specifically trying to import `BasicAer` from the top level `qiskit` package. This is again a symptom of API changes in Qiskit 1.0+. `BasicAer` was deprecated and removed. The previous installation of `qiskit-nature==0.6.2` also downgraded `qiskit-terra` to `0.46.3`. This version seems to be attempting to use components that are no longer available in the installed `qiskit` (which is still 2.1.2). The most likely cause is an incompatibility between `qiskit-nature==0.6.2` (which expects an older `qiskit-terra`) and the currently installed `qiskit==2.1.2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "To resolve this, we need to ensure a consistent version set. Since Qiskit 2.x is installed, we should try to use the latest compatible version of `qiskit-nature` with it. Looking at the `qiskit-nature` release notes, version 0.7.x is designed for Qiskit 1.0+. We had 0.7.2 installed initially, which failed with a `BaseEstimator` import error. This might indicate an issue with `qiskit-nature` 0.7.2 itself or a very specific incompatibility. However, trying to force an older `qiskit-terra` is likely to cause more issues with the main `qiskit` package.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's try reinstalling the latest `qiskit-nature` and see if the `BaseEstimator` import issue was transient or if there's another way to address it within the code by using the updated primitive interfaces directly if `qiskit-nature` 0.7.x supports it. If the same error persists, we might need to explicitly use the new primitive classes (`Estimator`, `Sampler`) in a way compatible with `qiskit-nature` 0.7.x or accept that this specific version combination is problematic in this environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, let's reinstall the latest `qiskit-nature` to align with `qiskit==2.1.2`.\n",

This suggests another version incompatibility issue within Qiskit, likely related to the visualization components used implicitly by the `print(qnn_circuit)` statement. To avoid this issue and focus on the core QNN implementation and training, I will remove the `print(qnn_circuit)` line which triggers the visualization module import that is causing the error. The rest of the code for defining the circuit, cost function, optimizer, and running the simulation should still be valid.\n",

This indicates that the `AerSimulator` was not configured to return the statevector. By default, `AerSimulator` might require specifying the desired output, such as the statevector or counts. To fix this, I need to configure the simulator to save the statevector after running the circuit.

This error occurs in the line `expectation_value = np.real(np.vdot(statevector, z_observable @ statevector))`. The `@` operator is used for matrix multiplication in NumPy, but `statevector` is a Qiskit `Statevector` object, not a NumPy array. To calculate the expectation value correctly, I need to convert the `Statevector` object to a NumPy array before performing the matrix multiplication or use Qiskit's built-in method for calculating expectation values. The `Statevector` object has a `.data` attribute which is the NumPy array representation. I will use this to perform the calculation.\n",
